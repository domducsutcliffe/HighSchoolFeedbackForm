There is no code yet for this project. 

For now I am just sticking the links to the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nz5KDs_MwZUSVJ6IECZzqM1kGxibcMfnq_NHrNm9GPg/edit?usp=sharing).
and the [form](https://forms.gle/MYoGf5D2vfhxFGW77) which I will fill out about myself.

At the moment this is literally just a place to hold the stuff, but I hope to introduce some automation soon. I teach about six classes a week and TA for two more so 1.25 classes worth
of data a day might add up to something. 

Some ideas for somewhere to start on the coding side of things.
* Gathering feedback from the students, annoymising it in a reliable way and storing it in a private repo (dur). 
* Comparing feedback for myself with feedback from students and measuring the delta between the two. This will be interesting in a literal 'I thought they understood metaphors, but clearly 
not kind of way' and also a more acedemic what is the difference between my perception of the classes and the actual execution of those classes.

* A more rigourous approach to making changes to materials and tracking if they had a positive impact. I think this would involve editing my materials (e.g. slides / games) within a certain commit (e.g. I add a slide explaining a concept using pictures and I say this is commit 83938938. Then I link the commit to a bug and make a judgement on whether the commit fixed the bug. I could take the analogy further with testing etc. but let's leave it there.)
* Marking! This is one I am quite excited about as the potential for automating marking is very high. However, so far all the materials I've marked has been written in pen. Curses!
